this is a simple calculator app that performs and records simple calculations 
the following changes were implemented after creating two issues:

- Comments were added within the program and throughout the various blocks of code. Comments were added within each of the functions. Comments are an important part of any program which are beneficial for both other developers and even yourself in the future.

- The comments were adjusted to start with a space and capitalised word unless it is a unique lowercase identifier.
